#Sprite sheet editor.

This project depends on libdansdl2.a on:

https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/libdansdl2.git

It presents the user with a graphical interface to create rectangular sections on a sprite sheet. Those rectangular sections are later saved to a text file. The format of said text file is compatible with other tools in these repositories.

As of November 5th 2015 the code has been patched with a compatibility layer to support many radical changes to the libdansdl2. Should the code be updated, the compatibility layer will be removed.

As of July 2016 the code has been updated to drop SDL2 graphic capabilities and now uses OpenGL. There should be a few glitches here and there.
