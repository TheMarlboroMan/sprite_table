# libdansdl2
C++ Wrappers for SDL2 and OpenGL.

As of July 2016 it has been overhauled to completely skew the SDL2 rendering so everything is rendered now with OpenGL. SDL2 continues in use in the audio, input and window management systems.

## TODO: 

- Revise uppercase constants.
- In the future, fork for OPENGL 1.4 and the rest.
